# RADS CAPSTONE GITHUB REPO

This repository holds the code for our capstone project. Our capstone project is a system that we are developing for the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs at Kean to assist with their university-wide event Research Days. This involves student registrations, confirmations, and many more elaborate details that have been done using excels and paper. In this project, we hope to create a system that can assist with their event for the long term.
